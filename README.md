# plex-discovery

## Application purpose

plex-discovery is intended to streamline how users explore their Plex Media Server libraries.
The application will connect to the official Plex API to surface media in a friendlier way than the
default Plex experience. By cataloguing available movies, shows, music, and photos, it will help
users quickly find what to watch, listen to, or share, and highlight new or trending content inside
their own server.
